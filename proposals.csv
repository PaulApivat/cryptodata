**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-missions-approval-ranking-example/6203). 

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions.

The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This proposal requires a vote to approve Phase 0's addition of the Security Council as a signer on a 2/2 multisig that controls protocol upgrades for OP Mainnet. This does not require any protocol changes, but as this represents a fundamental change to OP Mainnet's security model, it should be approved by the Token House. This is one of three votes required to fully implement the Security Council as outlined here: <https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885>


This vote requires a 76% approval threshold. The value displayed by the frontend may differ.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

You should only cast a vote if you want to override the decisions made by the Council. If this proposal is veto-d, the enforcement actions will go to a full Token House vote.

The upgrade is code complete as of commit [e6ef3a900c42c8722e72c2e2314027f85d12ced5](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/commit/e6ef3a900c42c8722e72c2e2314027f85d12ced5) ([release](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases/tag/op-contracts%2Fv1.3.0-rc.1) and [tag](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/op-contracts/v1.3.0-rc.1)) in the Optimism monorepo.

This proposal is eligible for Voting Cycle #19: 
<https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-6-multi-chain-prep-mcp-l1/7677>

If passed in the Token House, it will proceed to a veto period in the Citizens’ House.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 4, the Token House will approval rank Mission Proposals that work towards our [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). Missions are meant to be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish by the end of Season 4. They are not meant to fund persistent teams to provide ongoing services. Below are the Mission proposals under Intent #4: Governance Accessibility.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-missions-approval-ranking-example/6203). 

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 4, the Token House will approval rank Mission Proposals that work towards our [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874.). Missions are meant to be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish by the end of Season 4. They are not meant to fund persistent teams to provide ongoing services. Below are the Mission proposals under Intent #1: Progress Towards Technical Decentralization.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-proposals/6203)

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

This proposal outlines the Optimism Collective’s first network upgrade after Bedrock, titled Canyon. The Canyon upgrade contains the Shapella network upgrade from Ethereum, a change to reduce the volatility of the basefee, and several minor bug fixes. This upgrade maintains EVM equivalence and includes several OP Stack specific improvements.

Canyon is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit 6cce3728b7bed5e36234aeba3b773e0f97867be3 and op-geth at commit ed8e9f54ed0a5069e77ea34895ff12a9ac4ca17f
If this vote passes, Canyon will activate on op-mainnet, base-mainnet, pgn-mainnet, & zora-mainnet on Thu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024 (Unix Time 1704992401) barring a critical security issue.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 4, the Token House will approval rank Mission Proposals that work towards our [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). Missions are meant to be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish by the end of Season 4. They are not meant to fund persistent teams to provide ongoing services. Below are the Mission proposals under Intent #3: Spreading the Optimistic Vision.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-missions-approval-ranking-example/6203). 

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions. The remaining changes in this upgrade bring the core improvements from the L1 Dencun hardfork into the OP stack, including new opcodes and the beacon root support. While blob data availability requires L1 Dencun activation, the Ecotone upgrade can be activated independently of it.

If this vote passes, the Ecotone upgrade will be scheduled for execution on March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC. 

The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 4, the Token House will approval rank Mission Proposals that work towards our [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). Missions are meant to be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish by the end of Season 4. They are not meant to fund persistent teams to provide ongoing services. Below are the Mission proposals under Intent #4: Governance Accessibility.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-missions-approval-ranking-example/6203). 

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

In Season 4, the Token House will approval rank Mission Proposals that work towards our [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). Missions are meant to be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish by the end of Season 4. They are not meant to fund persistent teams to provide ongoing services. Below are the Mission proposals under Intent #3: Spreading the Optimistic Vision.

**NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST**

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission proposals will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission proposal must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked proposals, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-missions-approval-ranking-example/6203). 

 As a voter, you should vote yes on all Missions you think deserve grants, and you should abstain from voting on Missions you do not think deserve grants.

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions. The remaining changes in this upgrade bring the core improvements from the L1 Dencun hardfork into the OP stack, including new opcodes and the beacon root support.

If this vote passes, the Ecotone upgrade will be scheduled for execution on March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC. 

The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions. The remaining changes in this upgrade bring the core improvements from the L1 Dencun hardfork into the OP stack, including new opcodes and the beacon root support. While blob data availability requires L1 Dencun activation, the Ecotone upgrade can be activated independently of it.

If this vote passes, the Ecotone upgrade will be scheduled for execution on March 14th at 00:00:01 UTC. 

The upgrade will occur automatically for nodes on a release which contains the baked in activation time. Ecotone is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit f707883038d527cbf1e9f8ea513fe33255deadbc and op-geth at commit 0402d543c3d0cff3a3d344c0f4f83809edb44f10.

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

Season 5 will further decentralize the Foundation's role in processing violations of the Code of Conduct and remove enforcement responsibility from Token House delegates. Accordingly, the Foundation will authorize a Token House Code of Conduct Council, according to the [Council Framework](https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884). The Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead.

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

The Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead. The Foundation proposes an initial budget of 3,000 OP per Code of Conduct Council member, for a total of 18,000 OP to be dispersed out of the Governance Fund at the end of Season 5.

This is a proposal for the Ecotone network upgrade, which adopts EIP-4844 blobs for data availability and activates Dencun L1 extensions.

While blob data availability requires L1 Dencun activation, the Ecotone upgrade can be activated independently of it.

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #4: Improve Governance Accessibility.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553).

Accordingly, the Foundation will authorize a Token House Code of Conduct Council, according to the [Council Framework](https://gov.optimism.io/t/council-framework-and-renewal/5884). The Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead. The Foundation proposes an initial budget of 3,000 OP per Code of Conduct Council member, for a total of 18,000 OP to be dispersed out of the Governance Fund at the end of Season 5.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

If this vote passes, the L1 contracts which support the OP Mainnet network will be upgraded to the versions of those contracts in the optimism repo at commit 856c08b (tagged as release candidate op-contracts/v1.2.0-rc.1).

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #1: Progress towards technical decentralization. 

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #2: Grow the Superchain.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

In Season 5, the Token House will approval rank Mission Requests that work towards our Collective Intents. Mission Requests outline specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. Once approved, teams will apply to fulfill each Request by submitting a Mission Application. Below are the Mission Requests under Intent #3: Improve the Consumer Experience.

NOTE: YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR VOTE ONCE CAST

This vote utilizes approval voting. Mission Requests will be approval ranked based on the number of yes votes. Each Mission Request must receive a minimum number of yes votes, equal to 51% of quorum. Any Mission that does not receive > required number of yes votes will not qualify for a budget allocation. The top ranked Requests, above the minimum number of yes votes, will be accepted until the Intent Budget runs out. If a Mission would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. For examples, see [How to Vote on Missions Guide](https://gov.optimism.io/t/how-to-vote-on-mission-requests/6203).

As a voter, you should vote yes on all Mission Requests you think should be approved, and you should abstain from voting on Mission Requests you do not think should be approved. You can view some guidelines on factors to consider [here.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-evaluations/7553)

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

This upgrade, proposed by OP Labs, introduces a new L1 contract, the SuperchainConfig, along with improvements to the existing pause mechanism.The proposed upgrade takes the current incident response mechanism a step further, introducing a Superchain-wide pause mechanism that can enhance protection across multiple fronts, including the L1CrossDomainMessenger and withdrawals for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, which are additional security critical code paths that protect user assets.

The Grants Council plays an important role in the Collective and is assumed to persist unless a Council Dissolution Proposal is passed. 

The Token House must vote on a Council Operating Budget, thereby renewing the Council for another Season and electing the proposal author as Council Lead. Delegates are effectively electing the Council Lead that has authored an approved budget. 

The sole proposed Grants Council Operating Budget is proposed by Lund Ventures (Dane Lund) with a proposed operating budget of 440k OP: <https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-season-5-grants-council-operating-budget/6941>
